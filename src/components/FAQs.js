              We will discuss all your event requirements before giving a
              quotation as obviously fees charged will depend on the scale and
              nature of the event, complexity of planning and our level of
              involvement. We'll keep in contact with you regarding our time,
              hours spent, and liaise with you on specific items, but we'll also
              work to your budget and plan accordingly. You'll never be charged
              more than we agree upon and there will be no hidden extras or
              surprises.

              We are meticulous about keeping track of everything we need to
              spend money on. This is done by constant monitoring and updating
              <strong>spreadsheets</strong>, knowing where to prioritise
              spending and keeping aside a budget to cater for emergency
              contingencies.
